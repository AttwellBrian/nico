Backend Debugging
-------
Start the program with `./gradlew run` then you can attach a remote debugger to port 5005.

Frontend Debugging

You can run `yarn start` from the frontend module. File watcher will cause automatic hot reloads.
You may need to perform a `yarn install` the first time to pull in dependencies.
